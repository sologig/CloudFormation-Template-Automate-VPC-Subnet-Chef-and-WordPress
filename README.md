AWS Web Services CloudFormation Template

Objective:
Use CM tools such as Puppet, Ansible, or Chef to automate the installation of basic Drupal or WordPress. Setup a sample site. Automate the solution using Cloudformation template.
 
Deliverable:
A cloudformation template that accepts user inputs as parameters where applicable ( for example, Admin password). This template should setup VPC, create subnets, launch a CM instance, pull the necessary code (modules, classes, recipes etc) from a GIT repo (or S3), and configure the web instance for basic Drupal or Wordpress setup.
